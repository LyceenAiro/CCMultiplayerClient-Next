/**
 * New sync system — whole-state broadcast, replacing the original mod's per-entity
 * delta events (updateEntityPosition/State/Target/Animation + registerEntity buckets).
 * Those listeners are disabled in multiplayer.ts (USE_NET_SYNC) when this is active.
 *
 * Design (self-healing, no packet-loss states):
 *  - PLAYERS: every client streams its OWN full state (pos/face/anim/hp/sp) each
 *    frame. The receiver applies it to that player's mirror + party model. Missed a
 *    frame? The next one corrects it. The mirror keeps its collision, so the local
 *    player can hit it -> shared combat.
 *  - ENEMIES: only the instance host streams a compact block of EVERY live enemy's
 *    state (~15x/sec). Each snap carries the enemy's identity so members refer to the
 *    SAME creature the host does:
 *        i  = uid  — the host-stamped unique entity id (ig.Entity._lastId). Unlike
 *             mapId this is set for EVERY enemy, including EnemySpawner-spawned ones
 *             (which get mapId=0). Members look the uid up in a live registry built
 *             from the block.
 *        mi = mapId — for static map enemies this matches the member's own map enemy
 *             (same map data), so the member adopts ITS already-typed, already-placed
 *             enemy as the puppet (no re-spawn, correct appearance).
 *        t  = enemyInfo.type — lets a member spawn a correctly-typed fallback puppet
 *             when it has no matching map enemy (e.g. a host EnemySpawner creature the
 *             member stripped).
 *    Members do NOT run the Enemy AI on puppets (round 17): the AI's stateTimers /
 *    attack cycle were never synced, so member-side monster behaviour (attack timing,
 *    telegraphs) drifted from the host. Puppets advance only via the captured
 *    Combatant.update (anim / HP-bar / stun) while their position stays locked +
 *    interpolated from the block. Attack TIMING is host-driven: the host detects an
 *    attack anim edge and relays enemyAttack, which the member replays on its puppet
 *    toward the local player (setTarget + playAnim; the authoritative damage/feedback
 *    still arrive via the host's combatHit). An enemy the host no longer reports died
 *    there -> the member kills its puppet (and any local ghost the host never owned).
 *  - SERVER: just relays playerState (any) and entityState (host-only). Stateless.

	 *
	 * On the attacking player's own machine the attack ACTION step COMBAT_SWEEP calls
	 * sc.CombatSweep.show(), which spawns BOTH the damaging CircleHitForce hitbox AND
	 * the sheet effect. Mirrors only replay the animation (no action step runs), so
	 * teammates never saw the swing arc. We re-spawn just the VISUAL half here via
	 * EffectSheet.spawnOnTarget — never sc.CombatSweep.show (that would add a live
	 * hitbox on the mirror side and double-deal damage through the enemy strip).
	 * spawnOnTarget returns null/no-ops if the sheet isn't loaded, which is safe.
	 *
	 * v2 (round 11): element-tinted + class-aware sweeps. The playerState stream now
	 * carries the owner's element mode (em) and class string (cl), so mirrors pick
	 * the same COMBAT_SWEEPS family + key the engine itself would use:
	 *   attack/attackRev   -> COMBAT_SWEEPS[cl]          .keys[em] (+ "Rev")
	 *   attackFinisher     -> COMBAT_SWEEPS[cl+"_FINISHER"].keys[em]
	 * Unknown class falls back to SPHEROMANCER (round-9 behaviour). Skill SHOW_EFFECT
	 * visuals are synced separately via the EffectSheet hook (applySkillFx).
	 * ROUND 42 (item 2): also fire an audible sweep whoosh on the mirror for the art
	 * anims. The Lv1 neutral spin art (回旋斩 / "Spin Dance") has NO sound entry in the
	 * vanilla `special-neutral` sheet data, so nothing reached playAtEntity and the member
	 * heard the charge + release blips but NEVER the art firing. The sweep sheets' own
	 * effect audio is unreachable too (playAtEntity is wrapper-wrapped, and the mirror's
	 * effect doesn't target our player), so play the mirror's sweep sheet effect AND push
	 * an explicit whoosh directly through the wrapped playAtEntity under the loop-guard.
	 * A close-combat art anim (its name contains "spin" — spinFullLong/spinFullRev — or
	 * is attackLong/attackFinisher) uses the finisher family; a plain melee anim uses the
	 * base family, mirroring the engine's own COMBAT_SWEEP step choice. */
