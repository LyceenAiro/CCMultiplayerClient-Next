[![Discord Server](https://img.shields.io/discord/382339402338402315.svg?label=Discord%20Server)](https://discord.gg/SJmMZKy)

An online-multiplayer mod for [CrossCode](https://www.cross-code.com/). It lets
several players share the same world: each sees the other players' avatars
walking around, and the **host's** enemies, projectiles and combat are
synchronized to everyone else over a central relay server
([CCMultiplayerServer](https://github.com/LyceenAiro/CCMultiplayerServer)).

> **Status:** early development.
> Main-story test progress: Temple Mine.
> The mod was originally written for CrossCode **1.1.0** and the old
> **CCLoader v2**. This tree keeps it on **CCLoader v2** (the current,
> actively-maintained loader) while updating it for **CrossCode 1.4.2** (the
> final game release). It builds cleanly and the network protocol has been
> verified end-to-end against the server. In-game multiplayer has **not yet
> been battle-tested on a live 1.4.2 install** — see
> [Known limitations](#known-limitations--to-verify-in-game).
>
> **Development note:** This project is developed with **vibe coding**
> (AI-assisted development).

## FAQ

#### How is this mod different from [cc-multibakery](https://github.com/krypciak/cc-multibakery)?

* This mod focuses on story, side quests and co-op syncing. Its network
  overhead currently looks much larger than multibakery's. PvP and similar
  features aren't supported yet, but it aims for a more immersive story-driven
  co-op experience than multibakery.

#### How long until I can play this CCMultiplayer fork?

* You can start right now. Just run
  [CCMultiplayerServer](https://github.com/LyceenAiro/CCMultiplayerServer),
  install CCMultiplayerClient, and connect from the main menu. Saves are
  stored by the server, so you can play your account from any client.

#### Discord?

* Unfortunately I'm not very active in the Discord group — I may only check
  Discord once every two or three months, so this mod probably won't
  proactively share any information there.

#### Will this compete with cc-multibakery?

* I'll answer plainly: not unless its developer picks a fight with me first.
  Maintaining this mod has cost me a lot of money (vibe coding) and time on
  development and testing. I'd actually prefer multibakery to replace this
  project someday — I don't know TypeScript syntax and I'm unfamiliar with the
  CCLoader API, so fixing odd bugs is very difficult. Multibakery seems more
  polished everywhere, has lower network overhead, and even has a
  smooth-looking PvP mode — I have to give it a plug here.

#### How long until this project is finished?

* I don't know. I'm currently playing through it with a friend plus my own
  heavy testing and fixing. After two weeks of development the test run is
  still in the Temple Mine area, and the developer is a perfectionist who
  stops to adjust anything that looks off.

## How it works

CrossCode is a single-player game, so "multiplayer" here is really
**state mirroring**:

- One connected client is elected the **host**. The host's world is the source
  of truth for enemies.
- When a non-host client loads a map, every `Enemy` / `EnemySpawner` entity is
  **stripped out of the map data** before the level builds, and replaced with
  network-driven **mirror entities** spawned from the host's world.
- The host continuously broadcasts entity **position, animation, state, target
  and health**; clients apply those to their mirrors. To stop the local AI /
  physics from fighting the network, a mirror's `coll.pos`, `face`,
  `currentAnim` and `currentState` are replaced with read-only accessors whose
  values only the network may change.
- Each remote player is rendered locally as a special `multiplayer` enemy
  (defined in [`assets/assets/data/enemies/multiplayer.json`](assets/assets/data/enemies/multiplayer.json))
  whose `anims` are the normal player animations, then re-textured with the
  local player's proxies so it looks like a person.
- The host can change over the session (**host migration**): if the host
  disconnects the server promotes another client and entities are "unlocked"
  back to local control.

Communication is a socket.io relay: clients never talk to each other directly,
everything goes through `CCMultiplayerServer`.

## Features

**Connectivity & matchmaking**
- **Server list screen** (Minecraft-style): add / delete servers, **direct
  connect** by `host:port`, a live **reachability indicator** (online/offline +
  ping), all persisted without editing the config file.
- **Version gate** — the server rejects a client whose mod version differs.
- **Account login** — username is the identity (LAN trust); duplicate logins are
  rejected and recent usernames are remembered.
- **Main-city auto-match** — see
  [Main-city (shared town) mechanics](#main-city-shared-town-mechanics).

**World & combat sync**
- **Whole-state block sync** — players, host enemies and enemy projectiles are
  broadcast as whole-state blocks (self-healing, no packet-loss desync).
- **Host election & migration** — the first client in an instance is its host;
  the server migrates the host when it leaves.
- **Player state** — position / facing / animation / HP / SP / charge /
  cutscene / element / combat-class / guard timing.
- **Enemy sync** — host-authoritative, two cadences (15 Hz base + an
  option-driven hostile stream), plus enemy sounds / attacks / loot.
- **Dungeon mechanism sync (1.71.0)** — push/pull boxes, sliding blocks,
  floating platforms, switches, ice pillars and other puzzle entities sync
  inside dungeons via a compact `puzzleState` relay + host snapshots.
- **Dungeon box authority & smoothing (1.71.2)** — only one player can grip a
  push/pull box; the gripping client is the sole position authority, and other
  players' boxes follow with per-frame interpolation.
- **Dungeon box progress is personal (1.71.3)** — "box pushed onto the switch /
  plate half-lowered" is each player's own save progress (`map.entity…_placed`):
  `PushPullDest` plates are never networked, and a box that is already placed in
  YOUR save neither sends nor receives position, so one player's solved puzzle
  can never overwrite (or delete) another player's unsolved copy.
- **Dungeon platform authority (1.71.4)** — OL/dynamic/extract platform positions
  are host-authoritative: members apply the host's positions but never echo their
  own half-finished transition back, so the Temple Chamber 1 pillars sink/rise to
  their final height instead of oscillating at ~80%.
- **Dungeon box echo isolation & one-time switch latch (1.71.5)** — unowned
  push/pull boxes are also host-authoritative (gripping members stay owners), a
  box is snapped back to its real ground before a grip, and permanent
  `OneTimeSwitch`es (the Temple Chamber 1 attack switch) stay ON once any peer
  reports them on — a late joiner's stale "not triggered" state can no longer
  revert the party's solved mechanism or leave an unattackable switch behind.
- **Follower box vertical freeze (1.71.6)** — while a box's position is
  network-driven, its local z-physics is frozen; pulling a mechanism-raised box
  off its platform keeps it on the peer's real floor instead of dropping it into
  the pit (most visible on guest clients).
- **Quest kill-progress sync (1.71.7)** — real enemy defeats now advance the
  players' quest KILL subtasks. In normal multiplayer a kill only counts when
  the enemy died on the map YOU are on; in story-sync mode any party member's
  kill is relayed to the whole party regardless of map.
- **Real gravity after box release (1.71.8)** — when a teammate lets go of a
  box, the map-instance host no longer keeps it frozen at the network height:
  engine gravity resumes immediately, so Temple Chamber 1's upper-left box can
  be pushed off its ledge and actually falls to the lower floor instead of
  being pulled back up to the ledge.
- **1.71.9 fixes & QoL** — keyboard-typable port field; shared-town shop
  counters clear stale combat state and retry when a quest-solved dialog is
  stacked; remote skill charges darken the screen with one non-stacking effect
  tied to the party charge time-stop; light/full-party banners always render
  text; member network badges show the RELATIVE latency between you and that
  player; side-quest sync no longer rolls back or removes progress on end
  (already-solved players get a temporary "[Sync]" quest entry, no rewards);
  main-story sync clamps ahead-teammates to the leader's plot every frame;
  names are hidden during synced story videos; buffalo charge footstep loops
  are stopped correctly; sync-start fanfares are louder; off-screen teammate
  arrows and area/world-map teammate avatars were added.
- **1.71.10 external UI scale** — the Multiplayer options tab gains an
  **External UI Scale** setting (Auto / 50% / 75% / 100% / 125% / 150% / 200% /
  300% / 400%). It scales every mod-owned DOM surface — panels, server list,
  login, chat, toasts, tooltips, story banners, save block and off-screen
  teammate arrows — in one go. Auto uses the game's launch window size as
  100% and then follows window resizing; the fixed tiers are exact
  multipliers. In-canvas name tags follow the same setting (Auto = native
  game zoom).
- **Host handoff preserves enemy state (1.71.0)** — a sleeping/passive enemy
  stays asleep when the instance host migrates.
- **Host handoff keeps enemy spawn settings (1.71.2)** — the original
  `enemyInfo` attributes (`activeIf`, etc.) are shipped with the enemy block and
  restored on respawn, so the Temple Mine elevator bots stay asleep before the
  story unlock instead of waking instantly.
- **Story-leader action relay (1.71.0)** — external animations (sitting down,
  poses) the story leader performs are replayed on every member's leader
  mirror.
- **Combat feedback** — enemy hits, guards & perfect guards, counter /
  guard-break FX, skill sound/FX replay, and party-wide charge time-stop.
- **Death & respawn** — downed players become spectators; a full-party wipe
  reloads the checkpoint in lockstep.

**Social & party**
- **Parties** — invite / accept / decline / leave / kick, leader transfer, and
  "teleport to teammate" regroup.
- **Friends** — request / accept / decline / remove, request management, and a
  name search; the official companions can be re-added as friends (auto-accept).
- **Party bots** — the leader's follower bots are mirrored to members; offline
  friends can follow as "mod bots". In dungeons every network bot is culled
  (vanilla rule: follower entities are hidden inside dungeons), and they return
  automatically on leaving.
- **Story-locked companions (1.71.0)** — companions are only unkickable when
  the game's own `SET_MEMBER_LOCKED` flag is on, exactly like the vanilla
  Social menu; once a story event unlocks them the normal kick works again.
- **Room players** — see who is in your current map instance, plus a live online
  counter.
- **Party chat** — press Enter for a chat input with history and speech-bubble
  rendering (party-only).

**HUD & helpers**
- **Name tags** — show names / own name / bot names, gold leader name, ping
  display, adjustable opacity and size.
- **Network badges** — a green/yellow/orange/red diamond (ping/loss) on party
  portraits and the element indicator, with hover tooltips.
- **Network debug HUD** — live upload/download rates, packet loss, cumulative
  totals.
- **Mod options tab** — a dedicated "Multiplayer" options tab in the game menu.
- **Quick-menu (SHIFT) inspection** — online players and party bots are
  inspectable, with an add/remove-friend button.
- **Direct save+upload** — the bag-menu / ESC-menu save buttons upload straight
  to the server while connected.
- **Command box (F8)** — run `mp.*` console commands without DevTools.

**Saves & persistence**
- **Cloud saves** — your save is streamed from the server on login and restored;
  it uploads (chunked + rate-limited) on save and on exit-to-title.
- **Save mirror rollback (1.71.0)** — the server keeps the last **five distinct
  save images** per player. The login screen's **Rollback from Mirror** button
  logs in with the save stream held, shows the five snapshots with timestamps,
  and restores whichever one you pick.
- **Mirror picker close (1.71.4)** — the rollback picker has a **×** button that
  logs out, closes the socket and returns to the title screen without entering
  the game.
- **Anti-spam** — area-save throttling and a login-time upload suppression window.
- **Local persistence** — server list, options, login history and chat history
  survive restarts (localStorage).

## Main-city (shared town) mechanics

Six areas act as **main cities** (open matchmaking hubs) where players meet
without needing to form a party:

- **Rookie Harbor** (`rookie-harbor`, 新手港)
- **Rhombus Square** (`rhombus-sqr`, 罗姆斯广场, incl. 迎新桥)
- **Bergen Village** (`bergen`, 俾尔根村)
- **Ba'kii Kum** (`ba-ki-kum`, 巴基库姆)
- **Basin Keep** (`basin-keep`, 巴辛堡)
- **Homestedt** (`homestedt`, 家园)

Behaviour:

- **Whole-area instances.** The entire area counts as one main-city instance —
  every player anywhere in the area auto-matches into the same instance
  (`town:<area>[#N]`), regardless of which sub-map they stand on. A town
  instance is **not** keyed per sub-map.
- **Host = first in.** Like the wilderness, the first player to enter a channel
  becomes its host; host migration stays the same.
- **No party required.** Players auto-match to whoever is already in the city.
- **32 players per channel.** Each main-city channel holds up to 32 players;
  when full, the next player spills into a new `town:<area>#N` channel.
- **Traffic optimised for crowds.** To keep a 32-player room cheap:
  - player state (HP / EXP / SP …) syncs at **1 Hz**;
  - position syncs at **10 Hz**;
  - enemy / projectile sync packets are **not** sent (towns have no enemies);
  - party **bots** are **not** synced — they stay visible only to their own
    party leader;
  - ghost chests remain **party-only**.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| CrossCode | **1.4.2** (final release; the game is no longer updated) |
| Mod loader | **CCLoader v2** (the current, actively-maintained loader) — it bundles the `simplify` library this mod uses |
| Node.js (build + server) | ≥ 18 |
| Relay server | [CCMultiplayerServer](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCMultiplayerServer) |

## Building

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This produces `dist/`:

```
dist/
├─ mod.js               # the mod, one bundled classic script (runs via CCLoader v2 `main`)
├─ mod.js.map
├─ data/enemies/multiplayer.json   # game asset (mirror-player enemy type)
└─ config/config.json              # default server list
```

Useful scripts:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | one-off production bundle via esbuild |
| `npm run watch` | rebuild on change |
| `npm run check` | type-check only (`tsc --noEmit`) against the 1.4.0 typedefs |

## Installing

1. Install **CCLoader v2** into your CrossCode 1.4.2 copy
   (see the [CCLoader repo](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader)). It ships
   with the `simplify` library mod, which this mod depends on.
2. Copy this mod folder into the game's `assets/mods/` directory so that the
   mod's `package.json` / `ccmod.json` sits at `assets/mods/multiplayer/`, with
   the compiled `dist/` next to it.
3. The manifest's `main` already points at the bundle (`"main": "dist/mod.js"`),
   and `ccmodDependencies` declares `simplify`, so the loader wires everything up.

## Running

1. Start a relay server (see the server repo), e.g.:
   ```bash
   cd CCMultiplayerServer
   npm install
   npm start          # listens on *:1423
   ```
2. Add the server to `config/config.json` (or use the bundled default).
3. Launch the game with CCLoader v2. On the **title screen** the second menu
   button is relabelled to **Connect** — click it, pick a server, enter a
   username, and the mod loads you into the host's current map.

## Configuration

`config/config.json` (copied to `dist/config/config.json` at build time) lists
the servers shown in the in-game picker:

```json
{
	"servers": [
		{ "hostname": "localhost", "port": 1423, "type": "http" },
		{ "display": "Public server", "hostname": "example.com", "port": 1423, "type": "http" }
	]
}
```

- `hostname` / `port` / `type` — where the socket.io relay lives (`type` is the
  URL scheme, `http` or `https`).
- `display` — optional friendly name shown in the server picker.

```

## Network protocol

Plain socket.io events. Client→server and server→client use the same event
names; the server relays to the relevant room members. The handshake:

```
client → server  "handshake"          { username, version, client }
server → client  "handshakeResponse"  { success, host, username, mapName }
```

Then, per map membership:

| Event | Direction | Payload | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `changeMap` | C→S | `{name, marker}` | server relays membership via `onPlayerChangeMap` |
| `onPlayerChangeMap` | S→C | `{player, enters, position, map, marker}` | spawn/remove a remote avatar |
| `updatePosition` / `updateAnimation` / `updateAnimationTimer` | both | pos / `{face,anim}` / timer | "me" avatar state |
| `registerEntity` / `killEntity` | both | `{id,type,pos,settings}` / `{id}` | host-authoritative entities |
| `updateEntityPosition` / `…Animation` / `…State` / `…Target` / `…Health` | both | `{id, …}` | mirror entity state |
| `throwBall` | both | `{ballInfo, combatant, dir, party}` | projectiles |
| `puzzleState` | C→S/S→C | `{map, entries}` | 1.71.0 dungeon puzzle snapshots; 1.71.2 adds `own`/`ot` box-grip ownership; 1.71.3 stops relaying PushPullDest / solved-box progress (personal save state) |
| `questKill` | C→S/S→C | `{enemy, map}` | 1.71.7 quest kill-progress relay: story-sync parties cross maps; otherwise same instance only |
| `saveMirrorRestore` | C→S | `{index}` | 1.71.0 restore one of the five save mirrors |
| `setHost` | S→C | `isHost` | host migration |

## Porting notes (1.1.0 → 1.4.2, on CCLoader v2)

This is the substance of the "adaptation to the latest version". The mod stays
on **CCLoader v2** and keeps using the **Simplify** library that ships with it,
so the loading mechanism and most of the plumbing are unchanged. The real work
was **updating the code for the 1.1.0 → 1.4.2 game changes** and modernising
the build.

**Loading mechanism (unchanged — CCLoader v2)**
- Still a classic script loaded via the manifest's `main` stage, bootstrapped
  off the global `modsLoaded` DOM event, with `ccmod.json` declaring the
  runtime deps (`ccloader`, `crosscode`, `simplify`). A `package.json` manifest
  is also kept in sync for npm.

**Build tooling (modernised)**
- webpack → **esbuild**, emitting a single classic (IIFE) script `dist/mod.js`
  that v2 runs directly. (socket.io-client is *not* bundled — under v2 the mod
  fetches the matching client library from the server at connect time via
  `simplify.loadScript`, exactly as before.)
- Hand-maintained `src/@types/*` →
  [`ultimate-crosscode-typedefs`](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/ultimate-crosscode-typedefs)
  (CrossCode 1.4.0), vendored under `vendor/`, plus a small local
  `src/simplify.d.ts` for the Simplify global.

**1.1→1.4 type/API tightenings fixed**
- `IMultiplayerEntity` no longer widens `Enemy.target` (now `sc.BasicCombatant`);
  it's an intersection type instead.
- `player.currentAnim` may be an animation-set object now → normalised to a name.
- `loadLevel`/`teleport` re-bound through the concrete `sc.CrossCode` type.
- `MapData` → `sc.MapModel.Map`; map-entity `settings` read loosely.
- Network-driven action/event-step payloads (`SHOOT_PROXY`, `DO_ACTION`,
  `spawnEntity` `skipHook`) are cast, since those internal shapes drift per
  version and are part of the mod's own wire protocol.

**Bug fixed along the way**
- `onEntityStateChange` stored the browser global `window.status` instead of the
  entity state (`this.last = status`), so entity-state updates fired every
  frame. Now stores the real state.

**Server**
- Unchanged functionally — it is a game-agnostic socket.io relay. Refreshed
  `package.json` metadata and verified `socket.io@4.x` interop with the client's
  `socket.io-client@4.8.x`, including a live handshake test.

## Known limitations & to verify in-game

These are the spots that can only be confirmed on a **live 1.4.2 + CCLoader v2**
install (they cannot be validated by compiling):

- **Title-screen button hijack.** `initializeGUI()` relabels a title-screen
  button by a *fixed index* (`buttons[1]` or `[2]` depending on platform). It
  now warns instead of crashing if the layout changed, but the index should be
  confirmed against the real 1.4.2 title screen.
- **Server list screen** is a dedicated DOM overlay (add / delete / direct
  connect / connectivity ping) opened from the relabelled title-screen button;
  worth a smoke test on the real 1.4.2 title screen.
- **Combat correctness.** The mirror-entity property-locking trick
  (`coll.pos`, `face`, `currentAnim`, `currentState`) is inherently
  version-sensitive; expect to tune it for 1.4.2 combat.
- **DLC / New Game+ content.** The mod predates the *A New Home* DLC; enemy
  types and maps added after 1.1.0 are synced by the same generic mechanism but
  were never tested.
- `ig.game.teleport` / `spawnEntity` are wrapped by direct assignment; other
  mods doing the same could conflict.

If you test on a live install, the browser console (`[multiplayer] …` logs) is
the first place to look.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Could not locate the title-screen button to hijack"** — the title screen
  layout differs; adjust `buttonNumber`/`children[2]` in `multiplayer.ts`.
- **No servers in the picker** — `config/config.json` wasn't copied; run
  `npm run build` and reinstall the mod folder.
- **"Could not login"** — that username is already connected to the server.
- **Mod doesn't appear / doesn't load in CCLoader v2** — confirm the manifest's
  `main` points at `dist/mod.js`, that `dist/mod.js` was actually built, and
  that the `simplify` mod is installed and enabled (it's listed under
  `ccmodDependencies`).
- **"Could not find our own mod via simplify.getMod()"** — the mod folder must
  be named/detected as `multiplayer` (the manifest `name`), which is what
  Simplify looks up.
